About Hangman:
Hangman is a classic guessing game between you and a friend. To start a game, choose a word (without telling your friend what it is!). Your friend will then try to guess the word you've chosen, one letter at a time. Each time your friend guesses a letter correctly, you must reveal the location(s) of the letter in the word you've chosen. For example, if you've chosen 'hangman' and your friend guesses 'a', you must tell your friend that the letter 'a' appears twice in the word, like so: _ a _ _ _ a _. However, each time your friend guesses a letter incorrectly, s/he is one step closer to being 'hung'. After ten incorrect guesses, your friend loses. Hopefully, s/he guesses correctly before then!
